Miner tries to discover gems that have been getting attention, but not too much, and present them
in a ‘app store’ type of interface. Although the update script currently does
not run yet, the theory is that you’d see a fresh page of upcoming gems, every day.

For Mac OS X, a ‘single site browser’ app is available, which allows you to install the gems with
a single click and see which you already have installed. Grab the latest from:

This was our entry for the http://rubyandrails.eu/rumble, which we won :)

Possible ideas for the site include integration in rubygems.org (gemcutter) and add voting with a
similar scoring technique. The app is just a baby, the sky is the limit. Patches are welcome!
