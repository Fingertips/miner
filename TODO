Mac App
=======

* Remove unused menu items

Later
* Make the gem installation async so the UI does't freeze
* Add helper from passenger pane to be able to run a command with root privs
* Use RubyGem API to get install directory
* Expose `is this gem already installed' function to JS

Web App
=======

* Markdown on gem description
* Make JS work to install gem
* Don't show install links (or a message that the user should run `gem install name') when the user-agent is NOT MinerApp
* Move inline onclick handler to a separate JS file and use data attribute for the gem name (otherwise the unobtrusive-police will shoot us)
